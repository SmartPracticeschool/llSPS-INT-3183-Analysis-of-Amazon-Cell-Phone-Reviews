# Analysis of Amazon Cell Phone Reviews

***************

## Project Description:
### Description:
90 percent of the consumers read online reviews before they decide to purchase any
Mobile phone from any e-commerce website. Online Mobile applications has
revolutionized the way consumers purchase mobile phones online as these apps have
all the information regarding any mobile phone at users finger tips. Amazon is one of
the best mobile applications which is considered as a treasure trove of all mobile
reviews, and their review system is accessible across all channels presenting reviews in
an easy-to-use format. So, there should be a system which analyses thousands of
reviews of unlocked mobile phones sold on Amazon.com to find insights with respect to
reviews, ratings, price and their relationships

### Solution:
This project aims at building a model to predict the helpfulness of the review and the
rating based on the review text. Corpus-based and knowledge-based methods can be
used to determine the semantic similarity of review text. We will be using Natural
language processing to analyse the sentiment ( positive or a negative) of the given
review . A sample web application is integrated to the model built.
